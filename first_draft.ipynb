Sincerely,       Edward Randolph  Deputy Executive Director for Energy and Climate Policy/  Director, Energy Division  \\x0cP.O. Box 800 8631 Rush Street Rosemead, California 91770 (626) 302-9645 Fax (626) 302-6396    Gary A. Stern, Ph.D. Managing Director, State Regulatory Operations  December 20, 2019 ADVICE 4116-E-A (U 338-E) PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ENERGY DIVISION SUBJECT: Supplement to Advice 4116-E, Implementation of Southern California Edison Company’s Consolidated Revenue Requirement and Rate Change on January 1, 2020 PURPOSE Southern California Edison Company (SCE) files this supplemental advice letter to reflect final California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC or Commission) and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved revenue requirements and rates and to submit tariff schedules reflecting the consolidated revenue requirement and rate changes that will be effective January 1, 2020. For administrative ease, this advice letter supplements and replaces Advice 4116-E in its entirety.1 Revised tariff sheets reflecting the revenue requirements and rate changes discussed herein are attached as Attachment A. BACKGROUND As discussed in more detail below, this Commission and the FERC have authorized SCE to change various components of its revenue requirements and rates on January 1, 2020. SCE’s consolidated revenue requirement change to be reflected in rate levels effective January 1, 2020 is an increase of $363.799 million from current revenue requirements.2  As SCE has previously informed the Commission,3 it currently takes SCE approximately five weeks to conduct the necessary testing and system updates in order to implement                                             1  These changes are made in accordance with General Order (GO) 96-B, General Rule 7.5.1, which authorizes utilities to make changes or provide additional information to a previous filing via the filing of a supplemental advice letter. 2  The revenue requirement set forth in this supplemental advice letter is identical to the revenue requirement set forth in the original Advice 4116-E. 3  See 2020 ERRA Forecast Application (A.)19-06-002 Exhibit SCE-6 (November Update) and SCE’s Opening Comments on the Proposed Decision in Rulemaking (R.)19-07-017, \\x0cADVICE 4116-E-A (U 338-E) - 2 - December 20, 2019 a rate change.4 Given the number and complexity of SCE’s electric tariffs, SCE requires a significant amount of time to update billing factors and run the necessary tests before it can implement new rates. Therefore, to the extent the Commission approves a pending application at its December 19, 2019 meeting that authorizes a 2020 revenue requirement change (e.g., 2020 Cost of Capital A.19-04-014), SCE will implement those authorized revenue requirements in its currently planned consolidated April 2020 rate change.5 6 Additionally, SCE’s January 1, 2020 consolidated revenue requirement and rates reflect the changes proposed in two pending Tier 2 advice letters: Advice 4087-E, implementing SCE’s refund proposal for pre-2009 vintage departing load customers in accordance with Decision (D.)19-08-022,7 and Advice 4103-E, implementing the 2020 post-test year revenue requirement in accordance with D.19-05-0208 (Pending Advice Letters).  SCE proposed in each of the Pending Advice Letters that the changes be implemented on January 1, 2020.  No parties protested the Pending Advice Letters, the protest periods for the Pending Advice Letters have closed, and none of the Pending Advice Letters have been suspended as of the date of this supplemental advice letter.  Accordingly, SCE respectfully requests that, through the approval of this Advice 4116-E-A, the Pending Advice Letters be considered effective pending disposition.                                                   Order Instituting Rulemaking to Consider Authorization of a Non-Bypassable Charge to Support California’s Wildfire Fund. 4  In addition, due to billing constraints, there must be a minimum of 34 days between rate changes. 5  D.15-10-037 authorized omission of the Base Revenue Requirement Balancing Account (BRRBA), Nuclear Decommissioning Adjustment Mechanism (NDAM), Public Purpose Programs Adjustment Mechanism (PPPAM) and California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) balancing account year-end balances from SCE’s annual ERRA Forecast proceeding and instead (and as described in the applicable preliminary statements) authorized the balances to be included in the year-end consolidated revenue requirement and rate change advice letter. In this advice letter submittal, SCE proposes to instead consolidate these changes in rates when it removes the 2018 ERRA Undercollection (D.19-01-045) from rates in April 2020 in the interest of rate stability. 6 However, as discussed later in this advice letter, SCE is implementing the 2020 Department of Water Resources (DWR) revenue requirements on January 1, 2020. A Commission Decision in R.15-02-012 was approved on December 5, 2019.  7  Advice 4087-E was submitted on October 15, 2019. 8  Advice 4103-E was submitted on November 5, 2019 and supplemented in part by 4103-E-A on December 3, 2019. \\x0cADVICE 4116-E-A (U 338-E) - 3 - December 20, 2019 JANUARY 1, 2020 CONSOLIDATED REVENUE REQUIREMENT  Table 1 below summarizes the revenue requirement changes by proceeding that the Commission and the FERC have authorized in various proceedings effective January 1, 2020.

Senate Bill (SB) 700 authorizes the Commission to extend annual collections for the SGIP for five additional years, from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2024.  On December 11, 2019 the CPUC issued a Proposed Decision authorizing customer collections of $166 million annually for the years 2020 to 2024 to fund SGIP consistent with the authorization \\x0cADVICE 4116-E-A (U 338-E) - 6 - December 20, 2019 established by SB 700.  SCE has 34 percent of the allocation ($56.44M annually/total collection of $282.2M). The Proposed Decision is currently scheduled for approval at the January 16, 2020 CPUC Business Meeting.  Therefore, as shown on Line 29 of Table 1, SCE is temporarily removing the SGIP funding from distribution rates, which results in a decrease of $56.648 million in January 1, 2020 rates compared to 2019 rate levels.  Upon Commission authorization of 2020 SGIP funding, SCE will include the funding amount in its next regularly scheduled consolidated revenue requirement and rate change. 4. 2020 California Solar Initiatives (CSI) Revenue Requirement   On June 10, 2015, SCE submitted Advice 3212-E-A modifying SCE’s Preliminary Statement Part U, California Solar Initiative Program Balancing Account (CSIPBA), pursuant to D.15-01-027, to reflect extended Multifamily Affordable Solar Housing (MASH) and Single Family Affordable Solar Homes (SASH) program authorized funding for the period 2015-2021. Consistent with D.15-01-027 and Preliminary Statement Part U, and as shown on Line 30 of Table 1, the collection of the funding for these programs is complete and therefore the revenue requirement is set to zero on January 1, 2020. This results in a $3.885 million decrease in distribution rates effective on January 1, 2020.   5. 2020 CARE Administration Program and Energy Savings Assistance Program (ESAP) Revenue Requirements   On November 10, 2016, the Commission issued D.16-11-022 in the 2015-2017 Low Income Program Plans and Budgets A.14-11-007, which was modified in D.17-12-009. These decisions set forth the parameters for the administration and participation in the CARE Program and the ESA Program and adopt annual funding amounts for these programs through 2020. On December 14, 2017, the Commission issued Resolution E-4885 adopting SCE’s proposed changes in the ESA and CARE Administration Program funding for program years 2017-2020. In addition, on January 4, 2019, the Energy Division approved SCE’s mid-cycle Advice 3824-E/E-A, which updated the CARE Administration program funding level.  Consistent with Ordering Paragraphs (OP) 2 and 4 of D.16-11-022, Resolution E-4885, and Advice 3824-E/E-A, and as shown on Line 31 of Table 1, SCE is including $65.067 million in funding for the ESAP and $6.579 million for the CARE Administration Program, for a total 2020 ESAP and CARE Administration Program revenue requirement of $71.646 million. SCE will reflect $72.461 million, including FF&U, in the Public Purpose Programs Charge (PPPC) rate levels on January 1, 2020, which results in an increase of $1.251 million over current 2019 funding levels.      \\x0cADVICE 4116-E-A (U 338-E) - 7 - December 20, 2019 6. 2020 Statewide Marketing, Education & Outreach (Statewide ME&O) Revenue Requirements   On October 3, 2019, SCE submitted Tier 1 Advice 4082-E in compliance with Commission D.19-01-005 Decision Authorizing Renewal of the Contract with the Current Implementer of the Energy Upgrade California Program, to Extend through the End of 2021. In Advice 4082-E, SCE submitted its October 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020 Statewide ME&O budget for the continued collection of Statewide ME&O funding from customers. In Advice 4082-E, SCE states that effective October 1, 2019, SCE will include $9.984 million of Statewide ME&O funding in the Public Purpose Programs Adjustment Mechanism (PPPAM) to be collected through the PPPC as directed in D.19-01-005.  Advice 4082-E was suspended by the Commission’s Energy Division on November 4, 2019. At the time this instant advice letter was finalized, the suspension remains in place; therefore, SCE is not reflecting the updated Statewide ME&O funding in its PPPC on January 1, 2020.9   7. 2020 Charge Ready Program (CRP) and Transportation Electrification Program (TEP) Priority Review and Standard Review Projects Revenue Requirements   On October 25, 2019, SCE submitted Tier 2 Advice 4092-E to implement the 2020 CRP Phase 1 Pilot, TEP Priority Review Projects and TEP Standard Review Project revenue requirements in distribution rate levels in 2020, in accordance with D.16-01-023, D.18-01-024, D.18-05-040 and D.18-12-006. Advice 4092-E was approved by the Energy Division on December 19, 2019 and made effective as of November 24, 2019.  Therefore, as shown on Lines 33 and 35 of Table 1, SCE is reflecting a 2020 CRP Phase 1 Pilot revenue requirement of $7.247 million and TEP Programs revenue requirement of $6.796 million, including FF&U, in its January 1, 2020 distribution rate levels.   8. 2015 and 2016 ERRA Review Applications  On August 9, 2018, the Commission approved D.18-08-007 in SCE’s 2015 Energy Resource Recovery Account (ERRA) Review proceeding (A.16-04-001), which among other items, directed SCE to refund to customers through BRRBA a net amount of $88,000 due to an under-collection in the Renewables Portfolio Standard Costs Memorandum Account (RPSCMA) of $1.015 million and an over-collection in the Project Development Division Memorandum Account (PDDMA) of $1.102 million. This                                             9  As described earlier in this advice letter, it currently takes SCE approximately five weeks to conduct the necessary testing and system updates in order to implement a rate change. Therefore, SCE will implement the 2020 Statewide ME&O authorized revenue requirement in its currently planned consolidated April 2020 rate change (assuming Energy Division’s approval of Advice 4082-E). \\x0cADVICE 4116-E-A (U 338-E) - 8 - December 20, 2019 decision also approved SCE’s proposed disposition of the net balance in the Department of Energy (DOE) Litigation Memorandum Account, as follows: (1) credit $30.748 million to the NDAM ($31.855 with interest and FF&U), (2) credit $3.246 million to the generation subaccount of the BRRBA, and (3) reduce the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) Units 2 and 3 regulatory asset by $71.555 million ($73.016 million less $1.461 million in litigation/consultant costs), including all interest accrued up to the time of the transfers. On October 25, 2018, the Commission approved D.18-10-031 in SCE’s 2016 ERRA Review proceeding (A.17-04-004), which among other items, directed SCE to refund to customers through BRRBA a net amount of $3.605 million due to an under-collection in the RPSCMA of $0.188 million, an over-collection in the Purchase Agreement Administrative Costs Balancing Account (PAACBA) of $1.076 million, and an over-collection in the Project Development Division Memorandum Account (PDDMA) of $2.717 million. This decision also approved SCE’s proposal to refund $79.182 million in unspent, uncommitted funds from prior Demand Response (DR) funding periods to customers. SCE reflected the 2015 and 2016 ERRA authorized net refunds in its April 12, 2019 rate change implemented through Advice 3977-E/E-A and transferred the approved amounts to the relevant ratemaking accounts for distribution to customers. As described in Section 10 below, the rate amortization period for the collection of the 2019 Z-Factor revenue requirement of $108 million ends on December 31, 2019, which will result in a rate decrease since SCE will be removing the $108 million from rates. For rate stability purposes, in this advice letter, SCE is also removing from rates the 2015 and 2016 ERRA authorized net refunds totaling $120.867 million (including FF&U) that were amortized in rates and returned to customers in 2019, thereby offsetting the rate impact resulting from the end of the Z-Factor amortization period.  This is reflected on Lines 36, 37 and 38 of Table 1.   Table 2 breaks out this revenue requirement change by rate component. 9. San Joaquin Valley Disadvantaged Communities (SJVDAC) Pilot Revenue Requirement On December 13, 2018, the Commission approved D.18-12-015 authorizing SCE’s SJVDAC pilot projects and authorized funding up to $15.411 million for these projects over a three-year period (2019-2021).  SCE’s SJVDAC pilot projects will explore cleaner and more affordable energy options to propane and wood burning for customers who reside in the SJV pilot communities of California City, Ducor and West Goshen and do not have access to natural gas. On July 12, 2019, SCE submitted Tier 2 Advice 3946-E-B pursuant to D.18-12-015 to, among other items, set forth the authorized funding amounts by year.  Consistent with D.15-01-027 and Preliminary Statement Part KK, and as shown on Line 46 of Table 1, SCE is reflecting a 2020 SJV DAC Pilot revenue requirement of $10.248 million, including FF&U, in its January 1, 2020 PPPC. \\x0cADVICE 4116-E-A (U 338-E) - 9 - December 20, 2019 10.   Z-factor Treatment Related to Wildfire-Related Liability Insurance  On February 21, 2019, the Commission approved Resolution E-4994, which granted SCE’s Advice 3768-E request of Z-factor treatment for wildfire-related liability insurance costs in the amount of $107.156 million. Pursuant to Resolution E-4994, SCE amortized the collection of the revenue requirement in 2019 (April 4, 2019 – December 31, 2019). Therefore, as shown on Line 47 of Table 1, SCE is removing the 2019 Z-Factor revenue requirement of $108.400 million (includes FF&U) from rates effective January 1, 2020.  11. 2019 FERC-Jurisdictional Revenue Requirement  i. Base Transmission Revenue Requirement (Base TRR)   On November 22, 2019, in Docket No. ER19-1553 filed at FERC, SCE submitted its 2020 Annual Update (TO2020 Annual Update) of its Base TRR and associated Base transmission rates to be effective on January 1, 2020. The Base TRR for TO2020 is $962.976 million and reflects the settlement of TO2018 and the partial settlement of TO2019A. As shown on Line 50 of Table 1, SCE is reflecting a 2020 Base TRR revenue requirement of $962.976 million, including FF&U, which is a decrease of $76.578 million from the 2019 Base TRR (TO2019) revenue requirement of $1,039.554 million (sales adjusted). ii. Transmission Revenue Balancing Account Adjustment (TRBAA), Reliability Service Balancing Account Adjustment (RSBAA) and Transmission Access Charge Balancing Account (TACBA) On October 31, 2019, the RSBAA update for 2020 was filed with FERC in Docket No. ER20-248-000 and the TRBAA update for 2020 was filed at FERC in Docket No. ER20-268-000. 10  Both filings were accepted by FERC with an effective date of January 1, 2020.    SCE’s Transmission Owner Tariff Change Adjustment (TOTCA) is comprised of the estimated retail TRBAA rate of negative $0.00076/kWh associated with a negative $61.372 million using 2019 sales,11 the proposed retail RSBAA rate of $0.00000/kWh, both to be effective January 1, 2020, and a TACBA amount of $47.491 million associated with a rate of $0.00055/kWh accepted by FERC for filing in Docket No. ER19-1480-000 effective June 1, 2019. Therefore, SCE is reflecting a net TOTCA revenue requirement of a negative $13.881 million in its January 1, 2020 consolidated revenue requirement.                                               10  On December 12, 2019, SCE submitted Advice 4125-E setting forth revisions to the RSBAA and the TRBAA to be reflected in transmission rates effective January 1, 2020. 11  SCE’s 2020 ERRA Forecast A.19-06-002 remains pending, and, therefore, a 2020 sales forecast has not yet been authorized. \\x0cADVICE 4116-E-A (U 338-E) - 10 - December 20, 2019 As shown on Line 51 of Table 1, SCE is including a total 2020 FERC transmission balancing accounts TOTCA revenue requirement in the amount of a negative $13.881 million, including FF&U, which is an increase of $8.784 million from the June 1, 2019 FERC TOTCA revenue requirement of negative $22.665 million currently reflected in transmission rates.  12.  2020 Department of Water Resources (DWR) Power and Bond Charges   On July 26, 2019, the California DWR submitted its 2020 revenue requirement determinations to the Commission. The Commission approved D.19-12-007 on December 5, 2019 adopting DWR’s proposal. SCE submitted Advice 4124-E on December 10, 2019 setting forth the revisions to the DWR Energy Credit and Bond Charge to be effective in rates on January 1, 2020. Pursuant to D.19-12-007, SCE is reflecting a 2020 DWR Power Charge revenue requirement of a negative $5.4 million with a corresponding DWR Energy Credit of $0.00007 and a 2020 DWR Bond Charge revenue requirement of $428.069 million based on the DWR Bond Charge of $0.00580 million per kWh and 2019 sales.12  As shown on Line 56 of Table 1, this results in a $56.930 million increase from the 2019 DWR revenue requirement.  REVENUE ALLOCATION AND RATE DESIGN  Pursuant to D.18-11-027, approving SCE’s 2018 GRC Phase 2 Settlement Agreements, SCE scales the currently effective rates for the Base Rates on a functional System Average Percent Change (SAPC) basis to recover its authorized functional revenue requirements. Optional rates are then rebalanced to ensure revenue neutrality with the Base Rates. In the first step of this process, currently effective rates are multiplied by the authorized sales forecast to produce present rate revenues. The present rate revenues are compared to the applicable authorized revenue requirement for each function, in order to determine the functionalized SAPC adjustment. Utility-Retained Generation (URG), Distribution, New System Generation, Nuclear Decommissioning, and Public Purpose Programs Charges are scaled based on the functional SAPC adjustment factors. The authorized SCE Generation revenue requirement is reduced to reflect the contribution of Direct Access (DA) and Community Choice Aggregation Service (CCA Service) customers through the revised Cost Responsibility Surcharge revenues (i.e., Power Charge Indifference Amount (PCIA) and Competition Transition Charge (CTC) revenues), prior to determination of the SAPC adjustment factors. Table 3 below illustrates the class average rate impacts associated with the consolidated January 1, 2020 revenue requirement change. Based on the revenue requirement changes included herein, bundled service customers’ present rate revenues on January 1, 2020 will increase by approximately 3.0 percent to recover SCE’s total January 1, 2020 revenue requirement.                                               12  SCE’s 2020 ERRA Forecast A.19-06-002 remains pending, and, therefore, a 2020 sales forecast has not yet been authorized. \\x0cADVICE 4116-E-A (U 338-E) - 11 - December 20, 2019 A typical non-CARE residential customer using 550 kilowatt-hours per month could see a monthly bill increase of $3.41 (approximately 3.1 percent), from a current monthly bill of $110.79 to $114.20.  A typical CARE residential customer using 550 kilowatt-hours per month could see a monthly bill increase of $2.36 (approximately 3.2 percent), from a current monthly bill of $74.82 to $77.18.

The Generation-related portion is reflected on Line 10 of Table 2, and results in an increase \\x0cADVICE 4116-E-A (U 338-E) - 12 - December 20, 2019 to the PCIA-eligible UOG Capital and Operations and Maintenance (O&M) authorized revenue requirement over amounts currently in rates (i.e., $686.584 million compared to $658.396 million).  These updates, in addition to the 2017 ERRA PCIA Refund discussed below, are reflected in the PCIA rates shown in Appendix A.13  2017 ERRA PHASE 2 PCIA REFUND On August 15, 2019, the Commission adopted D.19-08-022, which approves a settlement agreement that resolves the treatment of SCE’s PCIA charges for its pre-2009 vintage departing load customers.  A two-step implementation process was adopted whereby SCE (1) ceased billing the PCIA to pre-2009 vintage departing load customers for the above-market costs of Legacy UOG resources14 on October 1, 2019,15 and (2) will refund the pre-2009 vintage departing load customers for PCIA charges overcollected since January 1, 2017 (the retroactive effective date of the settlement agreement).  On October 15, 2019, SCE submitted Advice 4087-E to implement the refund portion of the settlement.  Refunds to the pre-2009 vintage departing load customers will commence with the January 1, 2020 consolidated rate change and apply for 12 months (January 2020 to December 2020).  SCE is using a calculated Refund Rate sur-credit that will be added to the 2001 and 2004 departing load customer PCIA rates effective between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, as reflected in Table 5 of Advice 4087-E.   PROPOSED TARIFF CHANGES In addition to the revenue requirement changes discussed above, the tariff schedules included in Attachment A reflect: (1) the DWR Energy Credit of $0.00007 and the 2020 DWR Bond Charge of $0.00580 in compliance with D.19-12-007, and (2) revised RSBAA and revised TRBAA rates filed in Advice 4125-E. These rate changes will be reflected in SCE’s customers’ bills for service rendered on and after January 1, 2020.  In this advice letter, SCE is also modifying the following preliminary statements: (1) Preliminary Statement Part AA, CARE Balancing Account, to reflect 2019 and 2020 funding for both the CARE Administration Program and Cool Center costs pursuant to D.16-11-022, Resolution E-4885 and Advice 3824-E/E-A,16 and (2) Preliminary Statement Part HH, Energy Savings Assistance Program Adjustment Mechanism                                             13  The PCIA rates shown in Appendix A also reflect the updated DWRBC discussed in Section 12. 14  The above-market costs of Legacy UOG were the only generation resource costs in the pre-2009 vintage departing load customers’ PCIA rates.  However, consistent with the settlement agreement, the PCIA rates for these customers will continue to reflect the pass-through of applicable one-time net refunds (e.g., Energy Crisis-related refunds). 15  On September 10, 2019, SCE submitted Advice 4072-E to effectuate this change, with an October 1, 2019 effective date. 16  Due to an inadvertent error, SCE did not include the incremental funding amounts approved in Advice 3824-E/E-A for the year 2019 in Preliminary Statement Part AA, which SCE remedies herein. SCE will make an adjusting entry in the CARE balancing account to true-up for the ultimately authorized amounts for 2019. \\x0cADVICE 4116-E-A (U 338-E) - 13 - December 20, 2019 (ESAPAM), to reflect revised 2020 funding pursuant to D.16-11-022 and Resolution E-4885. In addition, in Appendix B SCE provides an updated Billed Revenue Allocation Percentages Table as required by Preliminary Statement Part WW, Portfolio Allocation Balancing Account (PABA). This advice letter will not cause the withdrawal of service, or conflict with any other schedule or rule.  TIER DESIGNATION Pursuant to GO 96-B, Energy Industry Rule 5.2, this advice letter is submitted with a Tier 2 designation.

Customer-Owned Electrical Generating Facilities:  (Continued) c. (Continued)   (1) Net Energy:  Net Energy is ES minus EF, where ES is energy supplied by SCE, and EF is energy generated by the customer and fed back into SCE's system at such times as customer generation exceeds customer requirements.  Only if Net Energy is positive shall Net Energy charges be applied at the rates specified above except that the Customer Charge will be applied in any case.  If the calculation of Net Energy yields a negative result, all such negative Net Energy shall be considered Net Energy transmitted and shall be treated as stated in Section (2), below.  The components of Net Energy, ES and EF, shall be separately recorded unless SCE and customer agree that energy fed back, EF, is negligible or zero, and so specify by waiver in the generation interconnection agreement.   (2) Net Energy Transmitted:  Net Energy transmitted occurs when the cumulative value of EF exceeds the cumulative value of ES during an entire billing period and is the amount by which the energy generated by the customer and fed back into SCE’s system exceeds the energy supplied by SCE over an entire billing period.  Such Net Energy transmitted will be purchased by SCE at a rate for payment equal to SCE’s applicable standard offer energy payment rate filed with the Commission.  A new rate for payment shall be effective for Net Energy transmitted on and after the effective date of each such filing.  (3) Billing:  Payment by SCE to the customer for Net Energy transmitted shall be included as a component of the customer’s bill for service rendered under this tariff.   (4) Standby:  Exempt from the charges of Schedule S.  7. California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Discount:  Customers who meet the definition of a Group Living Facility, Agricultural Employee Housing, or Migrant Farm Worker Housing Center as defined in Preliminary Statement, Part O, Section 3, qualify for a 28.7 percent discount off of their electric bill prior to application of the Public Utilities Commission Reimbursement Fee (PUCRF) and any applicable user fees, taxes, and late payment charges.  Eligible CARE customers are required to pay the PUCRF and any applicable user fees, taxes, and late payment charges in full. In addition, eligible CARE customers are exempt from paying the CARE Surcharge of $0.00524 per kWh and the Department of Water Resources Bond Charge of $0.00580 per kWh. The 28.7 percent discount in addition to these exemptions result in an average effective CARE discount of 32.5 percent. An application and eligibility declaration, as defined in Preliminary Statement, Part O, Section 3, is required for service under this Special Condition.  Eligible customers shall have the CARE Discount applied to this Schedule commencing no later than one billing period after receipt and approval of the customer’s application by SCE.  Customers may be rebilled on the applicable rate schedule for periods in which they do not meet the eligibility requirements for the CARE discount as defined in Preliminary Statement, Part O, Section 3.

Maximum Demand:  Maximum demand shall be established for all applicable TOU Periods. The Maximum Demand for each TOU Period shall be the measured maximum average kilowatt (kW) input indicated or recorded by instruments, such as SCE metering, during any 15-minute metered interval, but where applicable, not less than the diversified resistance welder load computed in accordance with the section designated Welder Service in Rule 2.  Where the demand is intermittent or subject to violent fluctuations, a 5-minute interval may be used.  8. Billing Demand:  The Billing Demand shall be the kW of Maximum Demand determined to the nearest kW. When applicable, the Time-Related Demand (TRD) component shall be for the kW of Maximum Demand recorded (or established for) the TOU periods, as applicable, according to the Customers rate Option. The Facilities Related Demand (FRD) component shall be for the kW of Maximum Demand recorded during (or established for) the monthly billing period.  However, when SCE determines the Customer's meter will record little or no energy use for extended periods of time or when the Customer's meter has not recorded a Maximum Demand in the preceding eleven months, the Facilities Related Component of the Demand Charge may be established at 50 percent of the Customer's connected load.  9. California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Discount:  Customers who meet the definition of a Group Living Facility, Agricultural Employee Housing, or Migrant Farm Worker Housing Center as defined in Preliminary Statement, Part O, Section 3, qualify for a 28.7 percent discount off of their electric bill prior to application of the Public Utilities Commission Reimbursement Fee (PUCRF) and any applicable user fees, taxes, and late payment charges.

Customer-Owned Electrical Generating Facilities:  a. Where Customer-Owned Electrical Generating Facilities are used to meet a part or all of the Customer's electrical requirements, service shall be provided concurrently under the terms and conditions of Schedule S and this Schedule.  Parallel operation of such generating facilities with SCE’s electrical system is permitted.  A generation interconnection agreement is required for such operation.  b. Customer-Owned electrical Generating Facilities used solely for auxiliary, emergency, or standby purposes (auxiliary/emergency generating facilities) to serve the Customer’s load during a period when SCE’s service is unavailable and when such load is isolated from the service of SCE are not subject to Schedule S.  However, upon approval by SCE, momentary parallel operation may be permitted to allow the Customer to test the auxiliary/emergency generating facilities.  A Momentary Parallel Generation Contract is required for this type of service.  11. California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Discount:  Customers who meet the definition of a Group Living Facility, Agricultural Employee Housing, or Migrant Farm Worker Housing Center as defined in Preliminary Statement, Part O, Section 3, qualify for a 28.7 percent discount off of their electric bill prior to application of the Public Utilities Commission Reimbursement Fee (PUCRF) and any applicable user fees, taxes, and late payment charges.  Eligible CARE Customers are required to pay the PUCRF and any applicable user fees, taxes, and late payment charges in full. In addition, eligible CARE Customers are exempt from paying the CARE Surcharge of $0.00524 per kWh and the Department of Water Resource Board Charge of $0.00580 per kWh. The 28.7 percent discount in addition to these exemptions results in an average effective CARE discount of 32.5 percent.  An application and eligibility declaration, as defined in Preliminary Statement, Part O, Section 3, is required for service under this Special Condition.  Eligible Customers shall have the CARE Discount applied to this Schedule commencing no later than one billing period after receipt and approval of the Customer's application by SCE.  Customers may be rebilled on the applicable rate schedule for periods in which they do not meet the eligibility requirements for the CARE discount as defined in Preliminary Statement, Part O, Section 3.  12. Billing Calculation:  A Customer’s bill is calculated according to the rates and conditions above.     The charges listed in the Rates section are calculated by multiplying the Total Delivery Service rates and the Generation rates, when applicable, by the billing determinants (e.g., per kilowatt [kW], kilowatthour [kWh], etc.),    As of January 1, 2012, all generation supplied to Bundled Service Customers is provided by SCE.  The DWR Energy Credit provided to Bundled Service Customers is determined by multiplying the DWR Energy Credit rate component by the Customer’s total kWhs.

Power Factor Adjustment:  (Continued)  An Interconnection Customer shall mean the entity that interconnects its generating facility with SCE’s transmission system.  9. Temporary Discontinuance of Service:  When the use of energy is seasonal or intermittent, no adjustments will be made for a temporary discontinuance of service.  Any Customer prior to resuming service within twelve months after such service was discontinued will be required to pay all charges which would have been billed if service had not been discontinued.    10. Customer-Owned Electrical Generating Facilities:  a. Where Customer-owned electrical Generating Facilities are used to meet a part or all of the Customer's electrical requirements, service shall be provided concurrently under the terms and conditions of Schedule S and this Schedule.  Parallel operation of such generating facilities with SCE’s electrical system is permitted. A generation interconnection agreement is required for such operation.  b. Customer-owned electrical Generating Facilities used solely for auxiliary, emergency, or standby purposes (auxiliary/emergency generating facilities) to serve the Customer's load during a period when SCE’s service is unavailable and when such load is isolated from the service of SCE are not subject to Schedule S.  However, upon approval by SCE, momentary parallel operation may be permitted to allow the Customer to test the auxiliary/emergency generating facilities.  A Momentary Parallel Generation Contract is required for this type of service.  11. California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Discount:  Customers who meet the definition of a Group Living Facility, Agricultural Employee Housing, or Migrant Farm Worker Housing Center as defined in Preliminary Statement, Part O, Section 3, qualify for a 28.7 percent discount off of their electric bill prior to application of the Public Utilities Commission Reimbursement Fee (PUCRF) and any applicable user fees, taxes, and late payment charges.  Eligible CARE Customers are required to pay the PUCRF and any applicable user fees, taxes, and late payment charges in full. In addition, eligible CARE Customers are exempt from paying the CARE Surcharge of $0.00524 per kWh and the Department of Water Resources Board Charge of $0.00580 per kWh. The 28.7 percent discount in addition to these exemptions results in an average effective CARE Discount of 32.5 percent.  An application and eligibility declaration, as defined in Preliminary Statement, Part O, Section 3, is required for service under this Special Condition.  Eligible Customers shall have the CARE Discount applied to this Schedule commencing no later than one billing period after receipt and approval of the Customer's application by SCE. Customers may be rebilled on the applicable rate schedule for periods in which they do not meet the eligibility requirements for the CARE discount as defined in Preliminary Statement, Part O, Section 3.  12. Removal From Schedule: Customers receiving service under this Schedule whose monthly Maximum Demand has registered 200 kW or less for 12 consecutive months shall be changed to an applicable rate schedule effective with the date the Customer became ineligible for service under this Schedule.

This Schedule is applicable when the maximum demand for the load to which reliability back-up service is provided is, in the opinion of SCE, expected to exceed 500kW.  Under this Schedule, reliability back-up service shall be provided only when SCE’s service, including standby service, is not available at the main service.  Service under this Schedule does not act as a guarantee of uninterrupted service.  Furthermore, reliability back-up service shall not be used to serve the load that is curtailed/interrupted under a load curtailment program in which a participating Customer agrees to curtail/interrupt its load when called upon to do so under the terms of such program or the curtailed load of a circuit during a California Independent System Operator (CAISO) Stage III Emergency Rotating Outage.  The Customer is ineligible for service under this Schedule when the main service is no longer eligible for Schedule TOU-8, TOU-8-S, or TOU-8-RTP-S.  Effective with the date of such ineligibility, the reliability back-up service and service under this Schedule shall terminate (See Special Conditions).  Service under this Schedule is subject to meter availability.    TERRITORY  Within the entire territory served.  RATES  The following rates are set forth for reliability back-up service metered and delivered at secondary, primary, and subtransmission voltages.
